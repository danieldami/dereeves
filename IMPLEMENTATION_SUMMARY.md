# Implementation Summary: Online Status & Call Features

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Online Status Display** (Admin & User)

#### Admin Dashboard (`frontend/src/app/admin-dashboard/page.js`)
- ✅ Requests online users list on mount via `get-online-users` event
- ✅ Listens to `online-users-list` response to populate initial state
- ✅ Listens to `userOnlineStatus` events for real-time updates
- ✅ Displays green dot when users are online, gray when offline
- ✅ Shows "Last seen" timestamp for offline users
- ✅ Disables call buttons when user is offline

#### User Chat Page (`frontend/src/app/chat/page.js`)
- ✅ Fixed duplicate `userOnlineStatus` handlers (removed duplicates)
- ✅ Requests online users list after user registration
- ✅ Listens to `online-users-list` response
- ✅ Listens to `userOnlineStatus` events for real-time updates
- ✅ Displays admin online status with green indicator
- ✅ Shows "Last seen" for admin when offline
- ✅ Disables call buttons when admin is offline

### 2. **Fixed Call Flow** (Bidirectional)

#### Outgoing Calls
- ✅ Admin can call users (audio/video)
- ✅ Users can call admin (audio/video)
- ✅ Call buttons disabled when other party is offline
- ✅ `CallModal` opens with `isInitiator={true}` for outgoing calls
- ✅ WebRTC offer signal generated and sent via `callUser` event

#### Incoming Calls
- ✅ `IncomingCallModal` displays caller info and call type
- ✅ Accept button opens `CallModal` with incoming signal
- ✅ Reject button sends `rejectCall` event to caller
- ✅ Admin receives incoming calls from users with proper signal
- ✅ Users receive incoming calls from admin with proper signal
- ✅ `CallModal` uses `isInitiator={false}` for incoming calls

#### WebRTC Connection
- ✅ Caller generates offer signal → sent to receiver
- ✅ Receiver generates answer signal → sent to caller
- ✅ Both peers exchange signals correctly
- ✅ Media streams (audio/video) established
- ✅ Call timer starts when connection is active
- ✅ Mute/video toggle controls work
- ✅ End call button properly terminates connection

### 3. **Backend Socket Events** (Verified)

#### Registration Events
- ✅ `register` event registers user/admin with socket ID
- ✅ Sends `online-users-list` to newly connected client
- ✅ Broadcasts `userOnlineStatus` to all other clients
- ✅ `get-online-users` event returns current online users

#### Call Events
- ✅ `callUser` → forwards to receiver with signal
- ✅ `incomingCall` → emitted to receiver
- ✅ `answerCall` → forwards answer signal to caller
- ✅ `callAccepted` → emitted to caller
- ✅ `rejectCall` → notifies caller
- ✅ `callRejected` → emitted to caller
- ✅ `endCall` → notifies other party
- ✅ `callEnded` → emitted to other party
- ✅ `callTimeout` → 30-second timeout for unanswered calls

#### Disconnect Handling
- ✅ User marked offline on disconnect
- ✅ `userOnlineStatus` broadcast with `isOnline: false`
- ✅ Active calls terminated if user disconnects
- ✅ User data cleaned up after 5 minutes

### 4. **Error Handling Improvements**

#### Login Page (`frontend/src/app/login/page.js`)
- ✅ Detailed error logging (status, response data)
- ✅ Shows specific error messages from backend
- ✅ Handles 400 (invalid credentials) and 401 (unauthorized)

#### Admin Dashboard
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for user fetch
- ✅ Redirects to login on 401 (token expired)
- ✅ Redirects to chat on 403 (not admin)
- ✅ Shows specific error messages

## 🎯 How to Test

### Test Online Status
1. **Start Backend**: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. **Start Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. **Login as Admin**: Use admin credentials
4. **Login as User**: Open incognito/another browser, use user credentials
5. **Verify**: Both should see each other as "Online" with green dot
6. **Disconnect**: Close one browser tab
7. **Verify**: Other side shows "Offline" with "Last seen" timestamp

### Test Call Flow (Admin → User)
1. **Admin**: Click voice 📞 or video 📹 button next to online user
2. **Verify**: Admin sees "Calling..." modal
3. **User**: Should see incoming call modal with admin name
4. **User**: Click "Accept"
5. **Verify**: Both see "In call" status with timer
6. **Verify**: Audio/video streams work
7. **Test**: Mute/video toggle buttons
8. **Either**: Click "End Call"
9. **Verify**: Both modals close, call ends cleanly

### Test Call Flow (User → Admin)
1. **User**: Click voice 📞 or video 📹 button in header
2. **Verify**: User sees "Calling..." modal
3. **Admin**: Should see incoming call modal with user name
4. **Admin**: Click "Accept"
5. **Verify**: Both see "In call" status with timer
6. **Test**: All call features work
7. **End**: Either party can end the call

### Test Call Rejection
1. **Start call** from either side
2. **Receiver**: Click "Reject"
3. **Verify**: Caller sees "Call was rejected" alert
4. **Verify**: Both modals close

### Test Call Timeout
1. **Start call** from either side
2. **Don't answer** for 30 seconds
3. **Verify**: Both see "Call timed out" alert
4. **Verify**: Both modals close

## 🔧 Key Files Modified

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/app/admin-dashboard/page.js` - Admin UI with online status & calls
- `frontend/src/app/chat/page.js` - User UI with online status & calls
- `frontend/src/app/login/page.js` - Enhanced error handling
- `frontend/src/components/callmodal.js` - WebRTC call modal (existing)
- `frontend/src/components/incomingcallmodal.js` - Incoming call UI (existing)
- `frontend/src/utils/socket.js` - Socket client config (existing)

### Backend
- `backend/src/server.js` - Socket.IO events for presence & calling (verified)

## 🚀 Production Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` for frontend (e.g., `https://api.yourdomain.com`)
- [ ] Update CORS origins in `backend/src/server.js` to include production domain
- [ ] Ensure `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` are set in backend environment
- [ ] Test on HTTPS (WebRTC requires secure context for camera/mic)
- [ ] Consider adding TURN servers for WebRTC (for users behind strict NATs)

## 📝 Notes

### Browser Permissions
- Users must grant camera/microphone permissions
- Permissions are per-origin (localhost vs production)
- Video calls require camera permission
- Audio calls require microphone permission

### WebRTC Configuration
- Currently using Google STUN servers
- Works for most networks
- For production, consider adding TURN servers for better connectivity

### Socket Connection
- Auto-reconnects on disconnect
- Re-registers user on reconnection
- Maintains online status across reconnects
